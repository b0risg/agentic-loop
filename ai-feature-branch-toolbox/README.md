# AI Feature Branch Toolbox

The AI Feature Branch Toolbox is a Python library designed for AI agents to interact with Git repositories and implement feature branch-based development. This library provides functionalities for initializing and connecting to Git repositories, managing branches, committing changes, merging feature branches, and more, all configured via a YAML file.

## Overview

The AI Feature Branch Toolbox leverages the following technologies:
- **Python**: The primary programming language for the library.
- **PyYAML**: For parsing YAML configuration files.
- **GitPython**: To interact with Git repositories programmatically.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main components:
- **`ai_feature_branch_toolbox/`**: The main library directory containing modules for Git operations, configuration management, CLI, and more.
  - **`git_operations.py`**: Contains the `GitOperations` class for handling Git operations.
  - **`config_manager.py`**: Manages loading and updating configuration from a YAML file.
  - **`cli.py`**: Implements the command-line interface for interacting with the library.
  - **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the module.
  - **`__main__.py`**: Entry point for the application.
  - **`config_validator.py`**: Validates the configuration settings.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests for various components of the library.
- **`config.yaml`**: Default configuration file for the toolbox.
- **`setup.py`**: Script for packaging the library.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies required by the project.
- **`README.md`**: Provides an overview and instructions for the project.

## Features

- **Initialize and Connect to Git Repositories**: Easily set up and connect to existing or new Git repositories.
- **Branch Management**: Create, switch, and list branches.
- **Commit Changes**: Stage and commit changes with customizable commit messages.
- **Merge Feature Branches**: Merge feature branches into the main branch with conflict detection.
- **Configuration Management**: Use a YAML file to configure repository settings, branch naming conventions, commit details, and more.
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Interact with the toolbox via a user-friendly CLI.
